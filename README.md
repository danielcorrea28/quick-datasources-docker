# Docker Datasources

This project aims to provide quick and easy steps for configuring database services so that you can start programming and testing as soon as possible.

## Notes

- The deployment instructions provided here are not suited for production use, please use them for testing and POCs only.
- On Linux, docker commands must be run as administrator.
- If you are deploying this on a hosting provider, you will need to use [Ngrok](Ngrok_example.md) to get a usable URL to connect to. If you use this locally, just remember to use `localhost`.


## General Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (Optional)

Navigate to the folder in which you want to store all the services present in this repository. Open a `cmd` and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielcorrea28/quick-datasources-docker.git
```

Then, go to the section for the service you want to run and follow the specified steps.
